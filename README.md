# gwt_super-spell

Elementary school educational software I developed in 2010 and 2011 to help my kids study Spelling,
Vocabulary and Math, as well as provide me an opportunity to learn GWT.  I did learn GWT, but best
of all, the software was actually very effective at improving the kids' grades!

It's deployed here: http://super-spell-ver-hrd.appspot.com

The UI was intentionally designed to look like a classroom chalkboard. It has all kinds of fun stuff
in the settings. Once a level of testing is completed, it allows the kids to play MIDI files of
songs they're familiar with.


I eventually ported the Vocabulary module to Android because it worked well with the platform. It's 
available for free at Google Play:

Things learned (or done) while developing the app: 
- using cookies to store user preferences
- writing code to identify browser type
- incorporating drag and drop functionality
- playing MIDI files in the browser
- temporarily disabling the Enter key to prevent accidental key entry
- reading sentences using Google translate (no longer functional due to Google closing it down as a free service)
- playing sound effects
- using custom fonts
- retrieving data from the server
- screen scraping dictionary.com to get phonetic spellings of words
